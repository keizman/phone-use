[‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](README_zh.md)

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üì• Installation
```bash
# Run directly with uvx (recommended, part of uv, no separate installation needed)
uvx phone-mcp

# Or install with uv
uv pip install phone-mcp

# Or install with pip
pip install phone-mcp
```



### üîß Configuration

#### start local file use python in cursor
excute command to install dependency:
```sh
pip install -e .
```

```json
          "phone-mcp": {
            "command": "C:\\Application\\conda\\python.exe",
            "args": [
                "-m",
                "phone_mcp"
            ],
            "cwd": "C:\\Download\\git\\uni\\phone-mcp\\"
        }
```

#### AI Assistant Configuration
Configure in your AI assistant configuration (Cursor, Trae, Claude, etc.):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "phone-mcp": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "phone-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you installed with pip:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "phone-mcp": {
            "command": "/usr/local/bin/python",
            "args": [
                "-m",
                "phone_mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> **Important**: The path `/usr/local/bin/python` in the configuration above is the path to the Python interpreter. You need to modify it according to the actual Python installation location on your system. Here's how to find the Python path on different operating systems:
>
> **Linux/macOS**:
> Run the following command in terminal:
> ```bash
> which python3
> ```
> or
> ```bash
> which python
> ```
>
> **Windows**:
> Run in Command Prompt (CMD):
> ```cmd
> where python
> ```
> Or in PowerShell:
> ```powershell
> (Get-Command python).Path
> ```
>
> Make sure to replace `/usr/local/bin/python` in the configuration with the full path, for example on Windows it might be `C:\Python39\python.exe`

> **Note**: For Cursor, place this configuration in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Usage:
- Use commands directly in Claude conversation, for example:
  ```
  Please call contact hao
  ```

- ADB is properly installed and configured

## üìö Advanced Usage

### App and Activity Launch

The plugin provides multiple ways to launch apps and activities:

1. **By App Name** (Two Methods): 
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Using app command (may not work on all devices)
   phone-cli app camera
   
   # Method 2: Using open_app command (alternative if app command fails)
   phone-cli open_app camera
   ```

2. **By Package Name** (Two Methods): 
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Using app command (may not work on all devices)
   phone-cli app com.android.contacts
   
   # Method 2: Using open_app command (alternative if app command fails)
   phone-cli open_app com.android.contacts
   ```

3. **By Package and Activity** (Most Reliable Method):
   ```bash
   # This method works on all devices
   phone-cli launch com.android.dialer/com.android.dialer.DialtactsActivity
   ```

> **Note**: If you encounter issues with the `app` or `open_app` commands, always use the `launch` command with the full component name (package/activity) for the most reliable operation.

### Advanced Package Management

The plugin provides comprehensive package management capabilities:

```bash
# Install multiple APK files from directory
phone-cli adb-install /path/to/apk/directory/

# Install with specific device ID (when multiple devices connected)
phone-cli adb-install /path/to/app.apk --device-id emulator-5554

# Pull entire directory
phone-cli adb-pull /sdcard/DCIM/ ~/Pictures/

# Clear app data and restart with one command
phone-cli clear-cache-and-restart com.example.app
```

Advanced app management:
1. **Clear Data**: Completely wipe app data and cache
2. **Force Operations**: Reliable stop/start cycles
3. **System Navigation**: Direct access to home screen and settings
4. **Bulk Operations**: Work with multiple files and directories

### Screen-Based Automation

The unified screen interaction interface allows intelligent agents to easily:

1. **Analyze screens**: Get structured analysis of UI elements and text
2. **Make decisions**: Based on detected UI patterns and available actions
3. **Execute interactions**: Through a consistent parameter system

### UI Monitoring and Automation

The plugin provides powerful UI monitoring capabilities to detect interface changes:

1. **Basic UI monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Monitor any UI changes with custom interval (seconds)
   phone-cli monitor-ui --interval 0.5 --duration 30
   ```

2. **Wait for specific elements to appear**:
   ```bash
   # Wait for text to appear (useful for automated testing)
   phone-cli monitor-ui --watch-for text_appears --text "Login successful"
   
   # Wait for specific ID to appear
   phone-cli monitor-ui --watch-for id_appears --id "confirmation_dialog"
   ```

3. **Monitor elements disappearing**:
   ```bash
   # Wait for text to disappear
   phone-cli monitor-ui --watch-for text_disappears --text "Loading..."
   ```

4. **Get detailed UI change reports**:
   ```bash
   # Get raw JSON data with all UI change information
   phone-cli monitor-ui --raw
   ```

> **Tip**: UI monitoring is especially useful for automation scripts to wait for loading screens to complete or confirm that actions have taken effect in the UI.
